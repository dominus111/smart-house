This project looks at an imaginary running of a smart house for 24 hours.\
The appliances usage consumes electricity and water. In addition the house has solar panels which can charge up a battery that can be used later for electricity.\
The program simulates 24 hours and gives an information to the user what was working each hour and the cost of the electricity and water used for that day.
